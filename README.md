# yFiles for WPF Demo Sources

This repository contains source code demos that use the commercial [yFiles for WPF](https://www.yworks.com/products/yfiles-wpf) software programming library for the visualization of graphs, diagrams, and networks. The library itself is __*not*__ part of this repository.

# Running the Demos

For most of these demos equivalent ones based on [yFiles for HTML](https://www.yworks.com/yfileshtml)
are hosted [online here](https://live.yworks.com/yfiles-for-html) for everyone to play with. Developers should [evaluate the library](https://www.yworks.com/products/yfiles-wpf/evaluate), instead. 
The evaluation version also contains these demos and the necessary library to execute the code.
